This is the beginning of the Final Project of the Consensys Bootcamp.  

## Problem

*For artists & Fans*

* Novel artist tend to have difficulties to get noticed and receive profits from their art. Maybe only a local community knows them, or family and friends. Not having a big fan base makes difficult to make profit from centralized platforms. As these tend to reward based on the traffic generated towards that content, which provekes that novel artist have a high entry barrier to make profit. 

* On the other hand, most well-known decentraliced marketplaces receive so many submissions that it is also very hard to get noticed if you're new. Also, these marketplaces sell at very high prices that suppose a great entry barrier for people that want to support their favourite local artists or friends but are not willing/can't invest big amounts of money.

## Solution

An art marketplace focused on novel artist where art can be sold fractionated. 
The artist can decide what fraction of the art wants to sell. 
By fractioning their art, the entry barrier decreases, as lower prices permit more people to afford buying a share of the piece.
