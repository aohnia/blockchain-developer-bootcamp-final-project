This is the beginning of the Final Project of the Consensys Bootcamp.  

_Problem_

*For artist* 

* Novel artist tend to have difficulties to get noticed and receive profits from their art. Lack of good contacts,  big fan base or an experienced manager make it even more difficult. 

* In music, p. eg centralized platforms reward based on the traffic generated towards that content, number of views, plays etc. 

* On the other hand, most well-known decentraliced marketplaces receive so many submissions that it is also very hard to get noticed if you're new. Maybe only your local community knows you, or your family and inner circle. 

*For buyers* 

* Current decentralized marketplace sell at very high prices that suppose a great entry barrier for people that want to support their favourite loval artists or friends but are not willing/can't invest big amounts of money. 


_Solution_ 

An art marketplace focused on novel artist where are art can be sold fractioned. 
The artist can decide what fraction of the art wants to sell.
